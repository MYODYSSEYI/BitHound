This Python project is designed to monitor and report on internet connectivity. Here's what it does:

Tracks Connectivity:  The script performs regular ping tests to a specified website or IP address, recording the latency (response time) of each test.

Visualizes Trends: It automatically generates daily plots that illustrate how your internet connection's performance changes throughout the day.

Delivers Reports: The script compiles daily reports containing the connectivity visualization and sends them via email.

Detects Issues: The script can be configured to send a report immediately if it detects a significant spike in ping times, indicating a potential connectivity problem.

Stores Historical Data (Optional): The script has the option to log connectivity data to a .log file for further analysis.

Use Cases

Troubleshooting Connectivity Problems: Identify recurring patterns of connection drops or slowdowns.
Documenting Network Performance: Track connectivity over time for personal or business records.
Remote Monitoring: Keep an eye on internet connectivity at a remote location.

Example 1: Email Report

Subject: Daily Internet Connectivity Report - 2024-04-03

Body:

"Please find attached the daily internet connectivity report."

Attachment: A PNG image file named "connectivity_report.png" containing a plot similar to this:

Sample Connectivity Plot: [invalid URL removed]

X-Axis: Time (e.g., 00:00 to 23:59)
Y-Axis: Ping (ms)
Line or Scatter Plot: Showing variations in ping results throughout the day
Example 2: Log File (uptime_2024-04-03.log)

A simple text file containing comma-separated values:

09:15, 22.5
09:20, 20.1
09:25, 23.8
...
17:45, 21.7 
17:50, 25.4
...
Important Notes:

The exact appearance of the plot will depend on your internet connection quality over the day.
It's possible that on some days the email report might be triggered due to a high ping spike (ping_result[-1] > 100 condition), indicating a temporary connectivity issue.
The log file format allows for easy import into spreadsheet or analysis tools.
Customization:

You can adjust the matplotlib plotting parameters to change the appearance of your graph (colors, markers, gridlines, etc.).
Let me know if you'd like a more specific example or if you have preferences for how the output should look!
